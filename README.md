gyro-php
========

Gyro-PHP is a PHP application framework offering Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 

It also comes with an extensive behavior layer based upon the command design pattern. This makes it easy to write complex, yet transaction-safe code. 
Commands offer undo functionality, too.

Additionally, Gyro-PHP comes with a set of modules and contributions to make every day web development tasks easier.

The framework was created around 2004 for PHP 4 and rewritten in 2005 for PHP 5.
